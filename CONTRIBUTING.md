# Contributing

Thanks for reading this guide! ♥ Contributions are super welcomed.
There are many things to work on: features, refactoring, tests, documentation, Wiki, supporting more OS, plugins (Pushover would be great) and so on...
Please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or email with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Roadmap
At the moment the project is still in pre-release state.
The tool/lib `taro` is already functional and available for contributions.
The components `taros` and `taroc` (repo to be published soon) haven't been properly implemented yet.
The first release is planned in Q3 or Q4 2021.

## Code Changes
Please be sure that all new code and modifications are fully documented and tested.
Please follow [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and any other good practices you learnt to keep the code pythonic.
