# Contributing

Thanks for reading this guide! â™¥ Contributions are welcomed.
There are many things to work on: features, refactoring, tests, documentation, Wiki, supporting more OS, plugins and so on...
Please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or email with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Roadmap
At the moment the project is still in pre-release state.
The tool/lib `taro` is already functional and available for contributions.
The components `taros` and `taroc` (repo to be published soon) haven't been properly implemented yet.
The first release is planned in Q3 or Q4 2021.

## Code Changes
Please be sure that all new code and modifications are fully documented and tested.
Please follow [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and any other good practices you learnt to keep the code pythonic.
